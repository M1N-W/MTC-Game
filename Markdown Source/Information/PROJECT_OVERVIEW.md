# MTC Game - Project Overview (Architecture-Only)

**Release alignment:** service worker cache id **`mtc-cache-v3.44.9`** (`sw.js` `CACHE_NAME`, auto-generated from `package.json` by `scripts/gen-sw-manifest.js`); see `Markdown Source/CHANGELOG.md` for per-version notes.

## Recent Changes

- **v3.44.9**: CSS border rollback (`char-select.css` reverts `color-mix` to `rgba` for wider browser compat), added `-webkit-user-select` in `shop.css`, trimmed Poom tutorial duration text, updated audit findings and walkthrough docs
- **v3.44.0**: Fixed Try-Again boss spawn-camp bug (`GameState._syncAliases` now mirrors `window.boss`/`window.drone`; `resetRun()` clears `_bossSpawnTimer`; `WaveManager._startBossWave` stashes timer id and guards against firing outside `PLAYING`; `game.js _teardownRunState` aborts Domain singletons). Cached fog/dark radial gradients in `WaveManager` with canvas-size + alpha-bucket keys; early-out on low fog alpha. Admin console hardened: 10 cmd / 2 s rate limit, `localStorage` audit ring buffer (`mtc_admin_audit`), destructive-command (`reset` / `kill all` / `set wave`) `yes` confirm gate, new `audit` command. Admin command guards unified under `COMMAND_META` registry in `AdminSystem.js`. `EnemyRenderer` adds per-entity `_lodFar` flag (screen-distance from viewport center) that skips ambient outer glow rings in `drawEnemy` / `drawTank` / `drawMage`. `effects.js` audit confirmed all subsystems (Particle / FloatingText / HitMarker / Weather / Orbital / Decal / ShellCasing) use pooled acquire-release + hard cap + swap-pop + `clear()` hook.
- **v3.43.2**: Fixed game freeze on death — introduced `showScreen()`/`hideScreen()` utilities in `utils.js` to prevent CSS specificity issues with full-screen overlay visibility, added prevention documentation to CSS
- **v3.42.3**: Fixed tutorial freeze and game over freeze issues — added defensive null checks in `js/tutorial.js` and `js/game.js` to ensure DOM elements exist before accessing them, added explicit visibility handling for overlays

This document is the architecture baseline for the current codebase.
It intentionally excludes balance values, cooldowns, damage numbers, and release-specific stats.

## 1) Runtime Stack and Execution Model

- Runtime: Vanilla JavaScript loaded by global script tags in `index.html`.
- Rendering: HTML5 Canvas 2D with static renderer classes and manager-owned draw passes.
- Audio: Web Audio API via `js/audio.js`.
- Authoritative frame loop: `js/game.js` owns `gameLoop`, `updateGame(dt)`, and `drawGame()`.
- Simulation and rendering are deliberately decoupled: update mutates world state, draw consumes the finalized snapshot.

Frame modes in `gameLoop` are part of the architecture:

- Hit-stop can skip `updateGame` while still rendering.
- Tutorial mode may run tutorial state without running the full gameplay update.
- Pause renders without advancing simulation.
- Game over stops the normal RAF gameplay loop.

---

## 2) Script Load Order and Dependency Chain

## 3) Class Hierarchy and Runtime Surfaces

### 3.1 Core inheritance tree

- `Entity` (`js/entities/base.js`)
  - `Player` (`js/entities/player/PlayerBase.js`, exported as `window.Player`)
    - `KaoPlayer`
    - `AutoPlayer`
    - `PoomPlayer`
    - `PatPlayer`
  - `EnemyBase` (`js/entities/enemy.js`)
    - `Enemy` (direct `EnemyBase` subclass — most specific types inherit from this)
      - `SniperEnemy`
      - `PoisonSpitterEnemy`
      - `ChargerEnemy`
      - `HunterEnemy`
      - `FatalityBomberEnemy`
      - `HealerEnemy`
      - `SummonerEnemy`
      - `BufferEnemy`
      - `SummonedMinionEnemy`
    - `TankEnemy` (direct `EnemyBase` subclass)
      - `ShieldBraverEnemy`
    - `MageEnemy` (direct `EnemyBase` subclass)
  - `BossBase` (`js/entities/boss/BossBase.js`)
    - `KruManop` (`window.ManopBoss`, `window.Boss` aliases)
    - `KruFirst` (`window.BossFirst` alias)
  - Other direct `Entity` subclasses (not `EnemyBase` or `BossBase`)
    - `BossDog` (`js/entities/boss/ManopBoss.js`)
    - `GoldfishMinion` (`js/entities/boss/boss_attacks_manop.js`)
    - `Drone` (`js/entities/summons.js`, also exported as `window.DroneEntity`)
    - `NagaEntity` (`js/entities/summons.js`)
    - `GarudaEntity` (`js/entities/summons.js`, exported as `window.GarudaEntity`)

### 3.2 Non-Entity gameplay objects with frame contracts

- `HealthComponent` is defined in `js/entities/base.js` (same file as `Entity`). It is composed into combatants via `this.health = new HealthComponent(maxHp)`. Proxy getters on the owner (`hp`, `maxHp`, `dead`, `hitFlashTimer`) keep call sites backward-compatible.
- `UtilityAI`, `SquadAI`, `PlayerPatternAnalyzer`, and `WorkerBridge` are logic objects, not entities.
- `PoisonPoolEffect` and `FatalityExplosionEffect` participate in the `specialEffects` pipeline through `update()` + `draw()`, but do not inherit from `Entity`.

### 3.3 Renderer structure

- `PlayerRenderer`, `BossRenderer`, `EnemyRenderer`, and `ProjectileRenderer` are static dispatchers.
- Enemy simulation types remain in `js/entities/enemy.js`; enemy canvas rendering is decoupled into `js/rendering/EnemyRenderer.js`.
- Renderer dispatch is keyed by constructor identity and `instanceof`.
- Renderers are consumers of simulation state, not owners of gameplay rules.

---

## 4) Update/Draw Separation Invariant

- `update()` paths own authoritative mutation: timers, HP, movement, AI, spawning, wave state, buffs, and damage.
- `draw()` paths and renderer methods own canvas output only.
- Draw code must not modify score, HP, cooldowns, spawn state, AI intent, wave progression, or authoritative positions.

Permitted render-local behavior:

- sprite or bitmap caches owned by renderer classes
- context state setup and cleanup
- deterministic visual animation derived from current read-only state

Forbidden render behavior:

- spawning gameplay entities
- mutating `window.enemies`, `window.specialEffects`, `projectileManager`, or `GameState`
- advancing cooldowns or status timers

---

## 5) Critical Invariants and Contracts

### 5.1 Enemy lifecycle contract

- `EnemyBase._tickShared(dt, player)` must run first in every living enemy `update()` path.
- `UtilityAI` writes intent into `_aiMoveX` and `_aiMoveY`; it does not own physics velocity directly.
- Shared enemy buffs and debuffs are normalized through `EnemyBase`, not duplicated in renderer code.

### 5.2 Wave and spawn contract

- `WaveManager` is the sole owner of wave progression, trickle spawn state, boss-wave entry, and wave-event activation.
- Enemy creation now routes through `window.ENEMY_REGISTRY` and registry-aware spawn selection.
- Wave-specific speed modifiers are centralized in `window.applyWaveModifiersToEnemy`, which is reused by normal spawning, admin spawning, and summoner-created minions.

### 5.3 Boss lifecycle contract

- Boss setup and cleanup span `WaveManager`, `BossBase`, boss subclasses, `game.js`, and `AdminSystem`.
- Boss-owned attack singletons and domain/singularity state must reset through every boss exit path, including admin shortcuts.

### 5.4 Array ownership and removal pattern

- `window.specialEffects` is updated in-place and uses swap-remove semantics in `game.js` for O(1) removals.
- Entity arrays and pooled managers are updated before draw and then read in draw passes without mid-frame mutation.

---

## 6) Hidden Cross-Module Coupling

### 6.1 Canonical and legacy state channels

- `GameState` is the canonical owner for phase and loop state.
- Legacy `window.*` globals remain compatibility surfaces for older systems and renderer access.

### 6.2 Enemy registry coupling

- `enemy.js` exports constructors and `window.ENEMY_REGISTRY`; `js/rendering/EnemyRenderer.js` consumes those constructors for render dispatch.
- `WaveManager` consumes the registry for wave composition.
- `AdminSystem` consumes the same registry for debug spawning.

### 6.3 Rendering cross-file coupling

- `drawGame()` orchestrates the frame, but `EnemyRenderer.draw()` saves the previous `window.CTX`, rebinds it to the current `ctx` parameter, executes in a `try/finally` block, and restores the saved value on exit. This lets fallback `draw()` paths and shared draw helpers reach the active canvas context safely.
- `mapSystem.drawLighting()` runs **outside** the camera transform (`CTX.restore()` ends the world-space translate before lighting begins). It depends on the full projectile array and static landmark positions provided by the caller.

### 6.4 Worker pipeline coupling

- `WorkerBridge` and `js/workers/analyzer-worker.js` feed `PlayerPatternAnalyzer` results back into gameplay consumers.
- Changes to analyzer data flow affect boss prediction and enemy aim prediction.

### 6.5 Optional cloud coupling

- Firebase bootstrap and cloud save systems depend on early load order and must fail soft so offline local play remains functional.

---

## 7) Rendering Pipeline Ownership

### 7.1 Frame draw sequence

`drawGame()` in `js/game.js` owns the canonical pass order. Steps 1–16 execute inside a camera `CTX.save()/translate(shake)` block; steps 17 onward are screen-space (outside that transform).

**World-space (inside camera transform):**

1. Background gradient fill
2. `mapSystem.drawTerrain()` — arena boundary, hex grid, zone auras, circuit paths, center landmark
3. `drawGrid()` — debug grid overlay
4. `meteorZones` visual indicators
5. `mapSystem.draw()` — walls, zone objects, MTC room
6. `drawDatabaseServer()`, `drawShopObject()` — interactive world objects
7. `decalSystem.draw()`, `shellCasingSystem.draw()` — floor-level battle scars
8. Low-HP navigation guide (dashed line to nearest heal source)
9. `powerups` via `EnemyRenderer`
10. `specialEffects` (update-driven, drawn sequentially)
11. `drone.draw()`
12. `PlayerRenderer.draw(window.player, CTX)`
13. Enemy list: `EnemyRenderer.draw()` per enemy; `BossDog` instances route to `BossRenderer`
14. `BossRenderer.draw(window.boss, CTX)`
15. `ProjectileRenderer.drawAll()`, `particleSystem.draw()`, `floatingTextSystem.draw()`
16. `drawOrbitalEffects()`, `hitMarkerSystem.draw()`, `weatherSystem.draw()`
17. `CTX.restore()` — **camera transform ends here**

**Screen-space (outside camera transform):**

1. `mapSystem.drawLighting()` — full-screen lighting pass; receives projectile array and landmark positions
2. `drawDayNightHUD()`, `drawSlowMoOverlay()`, glitch effect
3. `drawWaveEvent()`, `DomainExpansion.draw()`, `GravitationalSingularity.draw()`
4. `CanvasHUD.draw()` with `UIManager.draw` as fallback
5. `TutorialSystem.draw()` last

### 7.2 Resource management patterns

- `EnemyRenderer` owns a body-sprite cache.
- `BossRenderer` owns an offscreen bitmap cache.
- Manager-owned systems such as projectiles, particles, floating text, decals, and weather are updated elsewhere and drawn here.

## 8) Documentation Files and Stable Scope

| File | Location | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |

| `CHANGELOG.md` | `Markdown Source/` | Version-specific implementation notes |

This overview should stay stable by documenting only:

- class hierarchy and ownership boundaries
- initialization and dependency order
- update/draw separation
- critical invariants and hidden cross-file dependencies

This overview should not store:

- balance or config values
- damage, cooldown, economy, or spawn percentages
- release-specific tuning notes
- transient implementation details that belong in the changelog
